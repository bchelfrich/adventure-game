# adventure-game
 Creating a simple decision-based adventure typing game to practice my Python.

===========================================================================

This is a very simple Python project. The decision-based aspect is primarly built on While True loops and various if statements. We all gotta start somewhere!

The goal is to add different concepts over time and make it more advanced by the end of the project. Hopefully, we'll learn a lot about Python.

Feel free to download the code, and run to try out the game!
